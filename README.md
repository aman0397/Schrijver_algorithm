# Schrijver_algorithm
This is the C++ implementation of the Schrijver's, Submodular Function Optimization algorithm.
This is my project work for the summers 2017. A prior knowledge of Submodular functions, Min-Max theorem and the Edmond's greedy algorithm is required. This algorithm solves the NP-hard problem of submodular function minimization in polynomial time.
